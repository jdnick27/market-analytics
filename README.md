# market-analytics

This repository is a small Python project for analyzing stock data from Yahoo Finance and generating trading signals. It fetches price and volume data, computes technical indicators, and combines them into a composite signal written to CSV.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Fetching and Signal Generation (`main.py`)

`main.py` loads your Yahoo Finance API key from `.env` and defines the tickers to analyze. After downloading 30 days of data for each ticker, it calculates indicators and assembles a composite trading signal.

Example of loading the environment and defining tickers:

```python
load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv('YAHOO_FINANCE_API_KEY')
tickers = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT']
```

Indicator calculations are performed in `generate_signals` and the results are saved to `signals_output.csv`:

```python
if all_signals:
    combined_signals = pd.concat(all_signals)
    combined_signals.to_csv('signals_output.csv', index=False)
```

### 2. Indicator Implementations (`indicators.py`)

`indicators.py` defines simple classes for common technical indicators:

- **MACD** – Moving Average Convergence Divergence
- **RSI** – Relative Strength Index
- **VolumeIndicator** – detects volume spikes

Each class has a `calculate` method that appends the corresponding signal column to the DataFrame.

### 3. Signal Combination (`signal_manager.py`)

`SignalManager` stores individual signals and computes a weighted composite via `calculate_composite_signal`.

### 4. Configuration

A minimal `.env` file holds your Yahoo Finance API key so it is not checked into version control.

```
YAHOO_FINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 5. Example Data

`signals.csv` contains sample buy/sell flags for each ticker and date. The script output is written to `signals_output.csv` with the composite score.

## Pointers for Further Exploration

1. Learn how to use `yfinance` for downloading historical data.
2. Familiarize yourself with `pandas` for DataFrame operations.
3. Experiment with adding or modifying indicators via `SignalManager.add_new_indicator`.
4. Consider adding tests or automation to improve reliability.
5. Extend configuration (tickers, time ranges, weights) beyond the defaults in `main.py`.

This repository provides a basic framework for computing trading indicators and combining them into signals. You can extend it by adjusting weights, adding indicators, or scripting new analyses on the output files.
