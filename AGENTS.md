# Agents in this repository

This repository uses two cooperating actors:

- Human developers — make design decisions, review PRs, run and verify tests, and deploy.
- Automated coding agents (for example, GitHub Copilot or a Copilot coding agent) — suggested edits, branches, or PRs when requested.

When to ask the Copilot coding agent to act

- Routine changes: refactors, small features, type migrations, or adding tests.
- Prepare a PR: include the tag `#github-pull-request_copilot-coding-agent` in the request so the agent knows to create a branch and open a PR.

Repository-specific quick commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the project (current package.json): `npm run test` (the project uses `ts-node src/index.ts` by default)
- Build (if you add a build script): `npm run build` or `npx tsc -p tsconfig.json`

Git / PR conventions and review checklist

- Branch naming: `feature/<short-desc>`, `fix/<short-desc>`, or `chore/<short-desc>`.
- Open a PR against `main` with a short description and link to any related issue.
- Review checklist before merging:
	- Code compiles and types are clean (if TS: `npx tsc -p tsconfig.json`).
	- Run `npm install` and `npm run test` locally and confirm behavior.
	- No secrets are committed.
	- Changes are small and atomic; large changes should be split.

Secrets and environment variables

- Never commit secrets (API keys, credentials). Use `.env` locally and CI secret stores in pipelines.
- Add `dist/` and `node_modules/` to `.gitignore` if not already ignored.

Human review requirement

- All changes proposed or generated by an automated agent must be reviewed and approved by a human before merging.
